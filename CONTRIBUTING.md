Keep the project narrow: ChatGPT web-backed Codex models only. Generic providers and unrelated
OpenCodex product surfaces are out of scope.

Core invariants:

- Model selection is explicit; never silently fall back to another model or reasoning level.
- Full mode exposes local tools only through the active outer Codex registry and official MCP
  tunnel.
- Browser-only mode never creates a broker capability or attaches an MCP connector; Pro remains
  read-only in every mode.
- Browser state, API keys, tunnel IDs, cookies, Codex history, and absolute user paths never enter
  the repository.

Before opening a pull request:

1. Run `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and `bun run verify` on macOS or Windows. Installer changes
   should also run `bun run build:windows` and a local `scripts/install.ps1 -LocalBundle
   dist/runtime` smoke test on Windows.
2. Add a focused regression test for protocol, compaction, MCP, browser parsing, or installer changes.
3. Do not commit cookies, browser state, tunnel ids, API keys, local absolute paths, or generated logs.
4. Preserve fail-closed behavior. A UI selector failure must not pick another model or claim success.
5. Keep Terms/trademark claims factual and never market the project as quota or rate-limit bypass.

Browser UI changes should include the exact observed DOM evidence and a reproducible test fixture.
Do not broaden selectors speculatively.
